# sorting-hat
###An Introduction
In Harry Potter, students are sorted into 4 houses (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin), by a talking hat that can see inside their heads, but for people that want to be sorted in real life, the Wizarding World (formerly known as Pottermore), came out with a Sorting Hat Quiz. Basically, users answer 7 questions and are given their House at the end. I trained my own machine learning model to mimic the official Sorting Hat Quiz by using data compiled from over 2000+ sortings.

Just download the jupyter notebook and code from this repository!

All the data is courtesy of https://pottermoreanalysis.tumblr.com/, so a huge thank you to them for compiling all the data from thousands of sortings!
